USER ID IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS
============================================================

To add an auto-incrementing user ID as primary key, follow these steps:

1. Locate your User model in models.py (likely extending AbstractUser)
2. Note: Django models already have an 'id' field by default
3. Make sure your API serializers expose this ID

IMPORTANT: Django automatically creates an 'id' field with auto-increment!
You don't need to manually add it unless you've explicitly set a different field as primary key.

1. Check your User model:
   - If you're using AbstractUser, it already has an auto-incrementing 'id'
   - If you've defined a different primary_key, consider migrating to 'id'

2. Ensure your API serializers include this ID:
   In serializers.py, make sure your UserSerializer includes 'id' in fields:

   ```python
   class UserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
       class Meta:
           model = User
           fields = ['id', 'username', 'email', 'phone_number', ...] # Include 'id' here
   ```

3. Django migration commands:
   If you've made any changes to the model:
   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations app
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. Check database:
   You can confirm the ID field exists by inspecting the database:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM app_user LIMIT 5;
   ```

FRONTEND CONSIDERATIONS:
- No frontend changes needed as the ID is handled on the backend
- Just ensure that your API calls return and accept the ID field
- For new user creation, the ID will be auto-generated by Django

ERROR DEBUGGING:
- If you see 500 errors in your Community/Active Users endpoint, it might be due to missing IDs
- Check the relevant API view in views.py to ensure it's properly handling user IDs
